# 271-Self-Assessment

This course has been extremely beneficial to me because it has allowed me to obtain the necessary fundamentals to approach job interviews with more confidence and has taught me 
some valuable new techniques for building data structures and algorithms that maximize program efficiency. In terms of my performance in this class, here are my thoughts:

Participation: I believe that I was a very active participant in our class and that I was able to test my knowledge on a regular basis by answering the more difficult questions thrown out in our meetings. Although I felt like I could have contributed more, there were many times where I felt that it would be better to allow my other classmates to get a chance to contribute rather than overstep and take on all of the questions myself. I believe that I stayed very engaged in the classes, even when the content may have been more of a review than a lesson on new content, since I know how easily/quickly one can get rusty on programming fundamentals.

Challenges: My biggest challenge in this course was figuring out Codespaces. Although I had a good grasp of the way it worked by the end of the class, I was having a lot of trouble merging my changes with Professor Leo’s, and ended up having to take some time to get up to speed with Codespaces/Git in my free time. What I found was that codespaces would not always merge/update when I used the synch repo tool on my repository and in doing so, I learned some new Github CL commands!

Assignments: Although I struggled with some of the assignments, like the bidirectional linked list, I found that reviewing the solutions really helped me to rethink my approach and learn to use some interesting Java features like the Ternary Operator & post-increments to reduce the number of lines in my code and create more readable and efficient final products. On the last assignment, I think I did a great job with the hash and even shared it with some of my software engineering friends to get their feedback!

Responsiveness to feedback: I took the code reviews very seriously and this was a huge takeaway from my experience in this class. Because the initial assignments were not very difficult to implement without much planning, I got into a bad habit of coding my way to a solution early on in the class. After I started to notice some of my logical flaws at the midpoint of the course, I started to take a lot more time on the reviews and be tougher on myself. Although I graded myself on a stricter basis, it pushed me to be more thorough in my planning phase and try to anticipate/match my style as closely to Professor Leo’s ideal solutions and the Programmer’s Pact as I could.



Based on the above, I propose a course grade of an A.
